# Somni – Sleepless Vibe Coding of a Sleep-Enhancing App

## The Origin

When I was thinking about what project to prepare for the hackathon, I had many ideas. But this one came from life itself.

Although I usually don’t remember my dreams, these were vivid and recurring. I thought – interesting, how should I interpret them? Interesting that the same themes keep coming back. I wondered how others experience this. And how it could be explored.

## The Questions

There are as many answers to the meaning of dreams as there are people to ask. And I wanted to know them all:  
- The **scientific** perspective  
- The **spiritual/magical** one  
- And Jung’s **analytical** viewpoint  

So I decided to bring to life a group of *dream guides* using Eleven Labs who would answer all of these questions for me.

## Building Somni

Before the hackathon, I only knew RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) by name – something that works "under the hood." Despite that, I managed to:

- Design and prepare all the necessary data  
- Split books by Jung and Freud, scientific articles, and texts on Eastern dream interpretation into manageable chunks

I tested various models. Many, like the one I use for dream embeddings, are open-source and run for free in the backend. I spent a lot of time thinking about optimization.

The project kept growing. Ideas multiplied. But I managed to stay focused on the main goal without getting too distracted.

## The Tech

The project quickly outgrew the capabilities of Bolt. I tried my best to contain it, but eventually had to go beyond the ecosystem and use Claude Code for support.

Still, the foundations and main ideas were born in Bolt.

## Reflection

Curiosity drove me to build one of the most ambitious projects of my life. The possibilities of *vibe coding* are endless — taking on the roles of the entire team, from designer to backend engineer, I built a full-fledged mobile application on my own.

Of course, it's still an MVP, and I have many ideas for future development. As soon as I get some sleep, I’ll fork the repos and keep vibe coding.

## What’s Next

Now it’s time to move forward. I’ve already integrated:

- Vector databases  
- A fully functional React Native app  
- Multiple AI models for different purposes  
- Eleven Labs for voice synthesis  

The next essential step will be a **watchOS extension**, which will truly make *Somni* a unique application.

## Gratitude

Thank you for the opportunity to participate in the hackathon – for the spark that pushed me to go beyond my limits, and for the satisfaction of building something I truly believe in.
